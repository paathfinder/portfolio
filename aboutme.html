        <h1>About me</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>I am a 26 years old man, living in Serbia, working as
            building manager and head of technical support for one 
            condominium. I've finished highschool for programming,
            the one thing i was running from my whole life and now as times goes by,
            one of the things i would like to do the most is being Dev Tech engineer.
            <br>
            <br>

            What im doing to achieve that?
            <br>
            <br>
             I'm self financing my education, currently doing
            course on full stack web development with Dr. Angela Yu, after what I will buy a
            Python course from the same instructor.<br>
            When i finish i will lean into C# to refresh my knowledge
            which will help me to find a job in that area.
